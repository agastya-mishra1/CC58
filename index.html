My favourite parts of cricket are batting and fielding. I usually bat for 35 mins and field for 25 mins. Sometimes, I bowl instead of fielding for 25 mins. My dream goal is to be a brilliant international cricket player. To achieve that, I need to work hard both physically and mentally. I also idolize Kohli because he is extremely fit both mentally and physically. Due to that, he is considered one of the fastest cricket players in the world.
